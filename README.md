# neovim-konsole

This is a wrapper script and configurations files for running nvim as gui text editor in my Ubunutu desktop.


I tried to avoid most of key-binding limitations of a console vim.
this wrapper enable us to use
* Ctrl-S
* Ctrl-PageUP, Ctrl-PageDown
* Ctrl-Shift-PageUp, Ctrl-Shift-PageDown
* Distinguish b/w \<CR\> and \<Ctrl-CR\>
etc..

Then main reason to choose Konsole terminal emulator is its true-color support and its configurable keybinding mechanism

True color support for nvim is enabled by default.

Also, Desktop configuration files and resized icons are also included
